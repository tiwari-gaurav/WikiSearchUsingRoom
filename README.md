# WikiSearchUsingRoom
Search using WIKI API and using Room
This project is just for you to understand the basics of Room architecture in android. How to create an Entity class,
how the ViewModel and repository will communicate and how to make us of LiveData. For this I have used Wikipedia api for 
search. You can check this link https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Page_info_in_search_results for the request and response.
